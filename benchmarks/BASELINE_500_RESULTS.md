### Key Performance Insights

**Better-than-linear scaling observed** across all modes:
- **Triangle mode**: Only 4.91x slower for 10x shapes (50% efficiency)
- **Rectangle mode**: Only 6.24x slower for 10x shapes (62% efficiency) 
- **Ellipse mode**: Only 7.36x slower for 10x shapes (74% efficiency)

**CPU Utilization** (500 shapes):
- Triangle mode: ~6.0x CPU utilization
- Rectangle mode: ~6.2x CPU utilization  
- Ellipse mode: ~6.6x CPU utilization

### Performance Hierarchy Confirmed

**Consistent ranking** across both 50 and 500 shape tests:
1. **Rectangle mode**: Fastest (5.9-6.4 seconds)
2. **Triangle mode**: Moderate (7.8-8.6 seconds)
3. **Ellipse mode**: Slowest (13.2-14.8 seconds)

### Optimization Opportunities Identified

**Ellipse mode shows highest optimization potential**:
- 13-15 second runtime provides ample room for improvement
- Complex mathematical operations dominate execution time
- SIMD vectorization could yield significant gains

**Triangle mode optimization targets**:
- Validation algorithm improvements
- Memory allocation reduction
- Trigonometric calculation optimization

### Algorithm Efficiency Analysis

**Sub-linear scaling suggests**:
- Effective parallel worker utilization
- Possible optimization opportunities becoming more apparent with longer runtimes
- Memory caching benefits with repeated operations

**Performance bottlenecks become more pronounced**:
- Ellipse mathematical operations
- Memory allocation patterns
- Shape validation overhead

### Comparison with 50-Shape Baseline

| Performance Aspect   | 50 Shapes | 500 Shapes | Scaling Efficiency |
|----------------------|-----------|------------|--------------------|
| Rectangle efficiency | 100%      | 62%        | Good               |
| Triangle efficiency  | 100%      | 49%        | Moderate           |
| Ellipse efficiency   | 100%      | 74%        | Best               |

### Next Steps for Optimization

**High Priority (based on 500-shape results)**:
1. **Ellipse rasterization optimization** - Largest absolute time savings potential
2. **Memory pool implementation** - Benefits increase with shape count
3. **SIMD vectorization** - More impactful on longer running processes

**Medium Priority**:
4. **Triangle validation optimization** - Moderate but consistent gains
5. **Worker coordination tuning** - Fine-tune parallel efficiency

**Validation Target**:
- Post-optimization, target **25-35% improvement** in ellipse mode
- Post-optimization, target **15-25% improvement** in triangle mode
- Maintain or improve sub-linear scaling characteristics
